# kirby

English | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Finds the right skill, plugin or MCP server among your GitHub stars and star lists, or through a public GitHub search, and installs it at the scope you pick once you confirm.

It has three parts:

- **The `inhale` skill** searches your stars and star lists (or public GitHub), then judges and recommends skills, plugins or MCP servers that fit the task.
- **A mod** (`hooks/register.ts`, for Claude Code) provides the install tool `mcp__kirby__install`. An install through this tool waits for your answers in two dialogs.
- **An MCP server** (`codex/server.py`, for Codex) provides the search tools and an `install` tool with the same two dialogs.

The skill tells the model to install only through these tools, but that is an instruction, not a block: the model can still run install commands such as `claude mcp add` or `codex mcp add` itself.

Works in Claude Code and in Codex; the Codex version is described under [Codex](#codex).

## Requirements

- The [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) CLI, logged in (`gh auth login`)
- `git`
- `python3`

## Install

Claude Code:

```
claude plugin marketplace add Leo145x/kirby
claude plugin install kirby@kirby
```

Codex:

```
codex plugin marketplace add Leo145x/kirby
codex plugin add kirby@kirby
```

## Usage

Just ask, for example:

- "Is there a skill that draws architecture diagrams?"
- "Find a code review tool in my AI Tools list"
- "Search public GitHub for an MCP server that queries Postgres"

In Claude Code you can also invoke it directly with `/kirby:inhale`. The model may also use the skill on its own when a task needs it, but that is not guaranteed.

Every repo comes with its star count and last push date, as `owner/repo ★N · pushed DATE`.

### Default source

`stars` (default), `public` or `both`, set as kirby's `default_source` in `/config`. You can also say it in a prompt, e.g. "search public GitHub".

Public search only finds repos tagged with an agent-tooling topic (`agent-skills`, `claude-code-plugin`, `mcp-server`, …).

### Install flow

Once you pick a repo, the mod shows two dialogs:

1. **Next step**: Cancel / Read README first / Pick another / Install. The dialog lists the kind, commit, file count, any bundled scripts and a scan.
2. **Scope** (only after Install):

| scope | skill | plugin | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `local` | the project's `.claude/skills/`, added to `.gitignore` | `--scope local` (`.claude/settings.local.json`) | `--scope local` |
| `project` | the project's `.claude/skills/`, committed to git | `--scope project` (`.claude/settings.json`) | `--scope project` (`.mcp.json`) |
| `user` | `~/.claude/skills/` (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/` when that is set) | `--scope user` | `--scope user` |

Whatever the scope, a plugin's marketplace is recorded in your user settings.

Before the first dialog, the tool scans a skill's files, the same ones it installs, for patterns worth a look: hidden Unicode, HTML comments and phrases aimed at the model in Markdown; broad `allowed-tools`; mentions of agent settings and credential files; and in scripts, network calls, shell execution, decoding, secret environment variables and shell startup files. The dialog lists each flagged rule with where it hit. It is a pattern match, not a safety review: a hit is not proof of harm, and no hit is not proof of safety. Plugins and MCP servers are not scanned, and the dialog says so. The tool also gives the model the hits with the scanned commit, so you can ask it what a flagged line does. In Claude Code the model reads that file with `gh api`, which the skill does not pre-approve, so unless your permission mode allows it, Claude Code asks you first.

A skill installs exactly the commit the dialog showed. If the repo gets a new commit before the install runs, nothing is installed; the model tells you, and if you still want it, it shows the dialogs again with the new commit. Plugins and MCP servers are not pinned: a plugin comes from its marketplace as it is when the install runs, and an MCP server runs whatever its command fetches when it starts, such as `npx -y <package>`.

The model writes the dialogs' wording in the language you write in, in the format the skill gives. The facts above it (repo, stars, commit, files, scripts, an existing folder, the scan) and the prompt-cache note below the scope question come from the tool, in English. The scope dialog's options are always `cancel`, `local`, `project` and `user`. If the wording is missing or incomplete, the dialogs are in English.

### Installs and the prompt cache

Per the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/prompt-caching) and this project's own tests:

- **Skill**: no cache miss after installing (tested).
- **MCP server**: `claude mcp add` takes effect after a restart; the current session's cache is not affected.
- **Plugin**: loads with `/reload-plugins`. Its skills, hooks and the like don't affect the cache. If it brings an MCP server and tool search is off in the session (it is on by default), loading it rebuilds the cache once. Claude Code warns first and applies the reload only with `--force` (tested).

The plugin note is in the scope dialog, from the tool. The MCP note is up to the model: the skill asks it to mention it in the first dialog.

## Codex

The same repo is a Codex plugin. Codex reads `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, which loads the Codex version of the skill (`codex/skills/inhale/`) and an MCP server (`codex/server.py`, Python standard library only, declared in `mcp.json`). The Claude Code mod is not used there.

What differs from Claude Code:

- **Searches and reads go through MCP tools.** The server's `stars`, `public` and `detect` tools run the same scripts, and its `readme` and `file` tools read a README or one file at a commit from GitHub, all outside Codex's sandbox, so they do not ask for network access each time. These five tools declare that they only read, and with Codex's default approval settings Codex runs them without asking. It still asks before kirby's `install` runs; "Always allow" remembers the answer.
- **The dialogs are MCP elicitations.** The `install` tool shows the same two dialogs. As in Claude Code, the model writes their wording in your language, and the facts stay in English.
- **No `default_source` setting.** The default is `stars`; say "public" or "both" in the prompt.
- **Scopes:**

| scope | skill | plugin | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `local` | the project's `.agents/skills/`, added to `.gitignore` | — | — |
| `project` | the project's `.agents/skills/`, committed to git | — | — |
| `user` | `~/.agents/skills/` | `codex plugin add` (`~/.codex/config.toml`) | `codex mcp add` (`~/.codex/config.toml`) |

`codex plugin add` and `codex mcp add` have no scope option, so plugins and MCP servers install for the user only. If Codex does not say which project the session is in, a skill can only go to `user` too. In those cases the first dialog adds a line saying where it installs (`installs at: user …`), and the scope dialog's options are `cancel` and `install at user (…)`, so it is a confirmation in the tool's own words.

After installing, start a new Codex session to use what was added.

Codex also reads Claude Code's marketplace format. When a plugin comes from one, the dialog's facts name the marketplace file, and the skill asks the model to note that parts made only for Claude Code (such as hooks) may not work.

If you only say "install owner/repo", Codex may use its built-in `skill-installer` instead, which skips kirby's dialogs (seen in testing). If it asks to run that installer, decline and ask it to install through kirby.

## Scripts

In `skills/inhale/scripts/`. The first three are read-only and run without asking:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `stars.py` | Reads your stars and star lists (GraphQL), cached in `~/.cache/kirby/stars.json` for 24 hours |
| `public.py` | Searches public GitHub by agent-tooling topic |
| `detect.py` | Tells whether a repo is a marketplace, plugin, skill or MCP server, with what installing it needs |
| `install_skill.py` | Copies a skill folder into the chosen scope's skills directory and records the source commit in `.kirby.json`. `--check` only lists what would be installed, with the scan; `--commit` installs only the commit the dialog showed. Called by the mod and the Codex MCP server |

`detect.py --agent codex` looks for Codex marketplaces (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) first; `install_skill.py --agent codex` installs into `.agents/skills/`.
